# proof-of-concept for usage of k6

Sample proof-of-concept for demostrating different testing types using k6

## Pre-requisite Tools

1. k6 `https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/`
2. Visual Studio Code

## Setup

- Clone/Download the project from github

## Execution

- Execute `./run.sh` from terminal or command-line

Note: This is a sample POC for covering different non-functional testing types and it is not a framework. Creation of framework should involves time and efforts as it has to follow good practices and standards :thumbsup:
