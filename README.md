# proof-of-concept for usage of k6

Sample proof-of-concept for demonstrating different testing types using k6

## Pre-requisite Tools

1. k6 `https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/`
2. Visual Studio Code

## Setup

- Clone/Download the project from github `https://github.com/cvenkatreddy/k6-sample-poc`

## Execution

- Execute `./run.sh` from terminal or command-line
- Github workflows are configured for every commit to trigger `smoke.js` confirm smoke tests are passing without any issues

Note: This is a sample POC for covering different non-functional testing types and it is not a framework. Creation of framework should involves time and efforts as it has to follow good practices and standards :thumbsup:
